# Passwordless Logins

If passwords are an obstacle in your application, you may prefer to offer a passwordless login. In
this login process, a user must simply click a link from their email.

AuthN takes care of generating a secure one-use token while safeguarding against user enumeration.
Your application is responsible for delivering the token to the user by email.

## Configuration

* [`APP_PASSWORDLESS_TOKEN_URL`](config.md#app_passwordless_token_url)
* [`PASSWORDLESS_TOKEN_TTL`](config.md#passwordless_token_ttl)

## Implementation

### Backend

Your application must implement an endpoint (secured by SSL & HTTP Basic Auth) that expects a `POST`
webhook with `account_id` and `token` params. It should use the `account_id` to decide where to
deliver the `token`. When it is complete, it must return a 2xx status code or else AuthN will retry
the notification.

For example, a Rails application might use these params to send an email:

```ruby
class AuthnController < ApplicationController
  def passwordless_login
    @user = User.find_by_account_id(params[:account_id])
    AccountMailer.passwordless_login(@user, params[:token]).deliver_later
    head :ok
  end
end
```

### AuthN

Set [APP_PASSWORDLESS_TOKEN_URL](config.md#app_passwordless_token_url) with the full URL of your new
endpoint. For the example above, it might look like:

```bash
# development
APP_PASSWORDLESS_TOKEN_URL=http://localhost:3000/authn/passwordless_login

# production
APP_PASSWORDLESS_TOKEN_URL=https://user:pass@myapp.io/authn/passwordless_login
```

### Frontend

First, create a place for users to begin the process:

1. Create a form where the user may enter an account email.
2. Submit the email to AuthN. Note that AuthN always reports success.

Then, create a page that exchanges the token for a session after users click through an email:

3. When the page loads, use submit the `token` to AuthN
4. If successful, the user will be logged in.
